# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it via Xcode:

1. Open your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
2. Select `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator
3. Drop in the desired images.
